                                 kv/attn resources, plus its own sampler):

                                 iteration.

Because the text tokens never receive a timestep embedding, the understanding
K/V is denoise-step independent, so writing it once and re-reading it every step
matches running the whole transformer each step.

    Declaring the paged backend for such a step only costs the dense path's
    speedup; declaring the dense one for a step that does get a slot would try

        The engine leases the replay slot before the step is declared, so this
        answers from per-request state rather than from prepared inputs. It is
        the sole gate on capture — the v1 engine has no ``can_use_cuda_graphs``
        — so every condition the old gate checked lives here:

        * only the two-branch guidance regime is captured (both the prefill's
          combined cond+uncond pack and the denoise step's batched CFG);
        * of the denoise walks only ``image_gen``, and only at a resolution a
          graph was captured for (``_capture_layout``);
        * a batch shares one captured (batch size, token count) bucket, so a
          mixed-resolution batch falls back to the eager cross-request denoise.

        Every fact this reads is fixed for a request's whole lifetime (its
        guidance regime and its latent shape, both settled at prefill). That is
        a requirement, not a coincidence: the speculative pre-plan path leases
        a slot for step N+1 while step N is still in flight, before N+1 has
        been through ``prepare_inputs``, so a key derived from anything that
        advances per step (the denoise step index, say) would be read one
        iteration stale and could lease a bucket the declaration then
        contradicts. ``Engine.exec`` checks the two against each other.

        The guidance interval is the fact this deliberately does not consult:
        a captured step always runs both branches, so an out-of-interval step
        gets the guidance combine where the eager path would run the
        conditional branch alone (``postprocess`` combines unconditionally).
        That predates the v1 migration and matches the fused reference
        pipeline, which applies guidance on every step; honoring the interval
        here instead would make the key step-dependent, which is exactly what
        the pre-plan path cannot support.
