"""What a model declares about linear attention: its variant, its backend,
its spec, its step.

Kept free of the managers and their kernels so a submodule can declare a step
without pulling FlashInfer in behind it.

The wrapper half of the split `kv/` and `attn/` already use: the state lives in
a ``RecurrentStatePool``, and this resource plans and runs kernels against it.
Head geometry is not declared here — ``LinearAttnManager.build`` reads it off
the pool's blocks, so a model names its shapes once.
